Superhero Game – Student Task
Task Overview

Your mission is to create a simple superhero game in C++ without using any design patterns.
This is the “messy version” stage — the goal is to see what happens when you put everything into one place.

Later, you will refactor this code using design patterns to make it clean and maintainable.

Requirements

Create at least 3 superheroes

Each superhero should have a name, state (Normal, PoweredUp, Injured), and optional powers (Laser, Shield).

Implement hero actions

attack() → behavior depends on state and powers

defend() → behavior depends on state and powers

heal() → changes state if injured

Create squads

A squad can contain multiple superheroes

Calling attack() on a squad should trigger all member attacks

Simulate buttons or triggers

Create simple functions or classes to “press buttons” to make heroes perform actions

Demonstrate the game in a main function

Execute individual hero actions

Execute squad actions

Apply powers to some heroes

Change states dynamically
