“Why all this class / pattern ceremony? Why not just use functions?”

Let’s answer this honestly, not dogmatically.

Short answer (truth)

Functions are enough for small, simple, short-lived code.
Patterns + classes are needed when systems grow, change, and evolve.

Now let’s unpack that

Why NOT just a function?

You could do this:

void attackWithOldGun(OldLaserGun& gun) {
    gun.shootLaser();
}


✔ Works
✔ Simple
❌ But not scalable


The real problem: coupling

If you use functions directly:

if (weaponType == "oldGun")
    attackWithOldGun(oldGun);
else if (weaponType == "newGun")
    attackWithNewGun(newGun);


Problems:

Client code knows about every weapon

Every new weapon = modify existing code

Breaks Open/Closed Principle

This becomes a mess fast.
